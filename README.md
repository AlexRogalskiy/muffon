**muffon** is a desktop music browser / streaming service that retrieves info and audio/video from **Last.FM**, **Discogs**, **VK**, **YouTube**, **Deezer**, **Yandex Music**, **Odnoklassniki**, **Spotify** (partly), **SoundCloud**, **Bandcamp**, **Genius** and **Rate Your Music**. You can listen to artists, watch videos, browse tags and even listen to whole albums.

It has **no ads** and it's **absolutely free** to use.

It's built with **Vue** and **Electron**.

It's tested on **Windows 10**, but there are builds for **OS X** and **Linux** as well.

It's currently in **alpha**, so not everything's perfect and much to be done.

P.S. Unfortunately I don't know is it legal or not, but maybe you could tell me.
